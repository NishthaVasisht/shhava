# How to Avoid Creeps in Online Dating (2025 Guide)

Online dating should feel like a rom-com, not a horror flick. Here’s your no-nonsense playbook to keep it fun, safe, and creep-free.

## Quick Wins (Do These First)
- **Lock down your privacy**: Use in-app chat first. No phone/IG until trust is built.
- **Reverse-image check**: If the photos feel stocky/perfect, Google Lens them.
- **Video vibe check**: Do a 2–5 min video call before meeting IRL.
- **Meet in public**: Daytime, busy place. Share live location with a friend.
- **Hard boundaries**: “No” is a complete sentence. Block & report early.

## Red Flags (Swipe Left Immediately)
- Love-bombing on Day 1 (“You’re my soulmate”).
- Money asks, crypto/NFT “opportunities,” sob stories.
- Refusing video calls; delaying meets forever.
- Pressuring for nudes / “just one pic” / late-night hotel invites.
- Inconsistent details (age/job/timeline keeps changing).

## Green Flags (Keep Talking)
- Respect for your pace and boundaries.
- Plans specifics (time/place) without pushing.
- Mutual social proof (friends/hobbies) that checks out.
- Willingness to do a quick video intro.

## First-Meet Checklist
- Tell a friend your plan & share live location.
- Public spot, sit near staff/cameras.
- Buy your own drink; watch it poured.
- Keep exit options (a “call” after 30–45 mins).

## Text Scripts You Can Use
- **Boundary**: “Let’s keep the convo here for now — I don’t share my number early on.”
- **Delay**: “Not tonight, but down for a video intro this week.”
- **Decline**: “I’m not comfortable with that. Take care.”
- **Block**: No extra explanations needed.

## If Something Feels Off
- Screenshot and **report** the profile (it helps others).
- Block immediately — you don’t owe access to your time/attention.
- Trust your gut; leave the date if the vibe is wrong.
